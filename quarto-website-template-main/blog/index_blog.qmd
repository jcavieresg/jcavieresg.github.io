# About me!

I'm a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Geoinformatics-Big Spatial Data group lead by Meng Lu at Bayreuth University. We seek to propose geostatistical and machine learning algorithms for spatial and spatiotemporal models through an efficient computation.

My Ph.D thesis was supervised by Javier Contreras Reyes and Michael Karkulik, proposing different computational methods to incorporate a smoothing thin plate spline in spatial models.

During my Ph.D studies I did two very interesting internships; the first one in the Probabilistic Machine Learning group at Aalto University, under the supervision of Aki Vehtari. The second one was in the Computer, Electrical, and Mathematical Sciences and Engineering Division at KAUST, under the supervision of Paula Moraga.

I have also worked as Data Scientist in the retail (Cencosud-Scotiabank) and the forest industry (Arauco Celulosa).

Generally I use R, Template Model Builder ($\texttt{TMB}$) and $\texttt{Stan}$ to develop probabilistic models, but I am also interested in numerical methods (from a deterministic approach) for spatial models using $\texttt{Rcpp/RcppArmadillo}$.

Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:j.cavieres.g@gmail.com) if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects.
